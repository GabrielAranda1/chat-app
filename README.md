# chat-app
This is a chat application that allows multiple devices to connect to a room and exchange real-time messages.

In this project I used Node.js in the backend, with Express.js as a Http server and Socket.io for real-time data exchange. The frontend is built on React.js.

### Try it yourself

### Local setup

* You need to run `npm i` and `npm start` for both server and client folders
